# Real Agent Studio Execution in FlowWidget

üéâ **FlowWidget now supports REAL Agent Studio execution!** 

Instead of mock responses, your flows now run with actual AI models, live API calls, and genuine data processing using the same execution engine as Agent Studio.

## ‚ú® What's New

### Real AI Processing
- **Live LLM calls** to Ollama, OpenAI, or other configured models
- **Actual API requests** with real HTTP calls and responses  
- **Genuine data processing** through your flow pipeline
- **Real-time execution logs** showing each step

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Interactive input forms** automatically generated from your flow
- **Live progress indicators** during execution
- **Detailed execution logs** with timing and debug info
- **Rich output display** with JSON formatting and syntax highlighting

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Create Your Flow in Agent Studio
1. Open Agent Studio in Clara
2. Build your flow with input nodes, processing nodes (LLM, API, etc.), and output nodes
3. Export your flow as JSON (Export ‚Üí Clara Native format)

### 2. Add Flow Widget to Dashboard
1. On the Dashboard, click "Add Widget"
2. Select "Flow Widget" from the Productivity category
3. Upload your exported JSON file
4. Give your widget a name
5. Click "Add Widget"

### 3. Execute Your Flow
1. Fill in the input fields (automatically detected from your flow)
2. Click "Run Flow (Real Execution)"
3. Watch the real-time execution progress
4. View the actual AI-generated results

## üìä Supported Node Types

### Input Nodes
- **Text Input**: Simple text fields

### Processing Nodes
- **LLM**: Real AI responses from your configured models
- **Structured LLM**: JSON output generation with schema validation
- **API Request**: Live HTTP requests to external APIs
- **JSON Parser**: Data extraction and transformation
- **If/Else**: Conditional logic and branching

### Output Nodes
- **Output**: Display processed results
- **Any processing node**: Results from LLM, API, etc. are automatically shown

## üõ† Example Flows

### Simple LLM Chat
```json
{
  "name": "Simple Chat",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "input-1",
      "type": "input", 
      "data": { "label": "Ask me anything" }
    },
    {
      "id": "llm-1",
      "type": "llm",
      "data": { 
        "model": "llama3.2",
        "prompt": "Answer this question: {{input}}"
      }
    }
  ],
  "connections": [
    {
      "sourceNodeId": "input-1",
      "targetNodeId": "llm-1" 
    }
  ]
}
```

### Research Assistant  
```json
{
  "name": "Research Assistant",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "topic-input",
      "type": "input",
      "data": { "label": "Research Topic" }
    },
    {
      "id": "search-api", 
      "type": "api-request",
      "data": { "url": "https://api.search.com/q={{topic}}" }
    },
    {
      "id": "analyzer",
      "type": "llm", 
      "data": { 
        "prompt": "Analyze this research: {{searchResults}}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## üìù Execution Logs

The execution logs show you exactly what's happening:

- **üöÄ Flow Start**: Execution begins
- **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Node Execution**: Each node as it runs
- **‚úÖ Success**: Successful completions with timing
- **‚ùå Errors**: Detailed error messages
- **üìä Results**: Output data and transformations

Click the Terminal icon to view logs during or after execution.

## üîß Technical Details

### Execution Engine
FlowWidget uses the same `FlowExecutor` class as Agent Studio:
- Topological sorting for proper execution order
- Dependency resolution between nodes
- Error handling and recovery
- Memory-efficient streaming execution

### Data Flow
1. Input values are collected from the form
2. Nodes are executed in dependency order
3. Each node receives inputs from connected nodes
4. Results are passed to dependent nodes
5. Final outputs are displayed to the user

### Error Handling
- Network timeouts and retries for API calls
- Model availability checking for LLM nodes
- Input validation and type checking
- Graceful failure with detailed error messages

## üéØ Best Practices

### Flow Design
- **Start simple**: Begin with basic input ‚Üí LLM ‚Üí output flows
- **Test incrementally**: Add complexity gradually
- **Handle errors**: Include fallback paths for API failures
- **Optimize prompts**: Well-crafted prompts give better results

### Performance
- **Minimize API calls**: Batch operations where possible
- **Use appropriate models**: Choose model size based on task complexity
- **Cache results**: Consider caching for repeated operations
- **Monitor execution time**: Track node performance in logs

### User Experience
- **Clear input labels**: Make it obvious what users should enter
- **Provide examples**: Show sample inputs in placeholders
- **Explain outputs**: Label outputs clearly
- **Handle long operations**: Show progress for time-consuming flows

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Flow execution failed"**
- Check that all required inputs are provided
- Verify API endpoints are accessible
- Ensure models are available in your Clara setup

**"Unknown node type"**
- Make sure you're using supported node types
- Custom nodes need to be properly registered

**"Network timeout"**
- Check internet connection for API calls
- Verify API endpoints are responding
- Consider increasing timeout settings

**"Model not found"** 
- Ensure the specified model is installed in Ollama
- Check model name spelling and availability
- Try a different model if the specified one isn't available

### Getting Help
1. Check the execution logs for detailed error information
2. Verify your flow works in Agent Studio first
3. Test with simpler flows to isolate issues
4. Check Clara's console output for additional debugging info

## üöÄ What's Next?

Future enhancements planned:
- **Batch execution**: Run flows with multiple input sets
- **Scheduled execution**: Time-based flow triggers
- **Flow sharing**: Share flows between users
- **Advanced debugging**: Breakpoints and step-through execution
- **Performance metrics**: Detailed execution analytics
